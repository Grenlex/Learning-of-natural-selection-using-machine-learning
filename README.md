# Learning of natural selection using machine learning

This is a joint project with [Me](github.com/Grenlex), [Mikhail Shishking]() and [Tigran Apresyan]().

Here are given three folders[^1]: *rnn*, *selam* and *tasks*.

[^1]: Let me say in advance that file called ml.py are stored here just as the first example of our work. It was written using **numpy** and now this file doesn't affect our main program.
